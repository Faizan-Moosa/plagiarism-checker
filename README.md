The plagiarism checker can compare the word frequency from a pair of files.
A webpage is generated printing the results of the word frequency comparison.
To run the code download the plagiarism.c file and place it in a folder along with any files you wish to compare the word frequency of.
Please ensure the files are saved in the format 'test1.txt','test2.txt'...'test5.txt'.
To compile the code in the terminal type 'gcc -o plagiarism plagiarism.c' followed by ./plagiarism
You will then be asked in the terminal to select 2 files to compare and if successful a success message will be printed in the terminal.
Thereafter, you may go to the folder with all your files and see an 'wordFrequency.html' file generated which you can then right-click and open in your selected web-browser.
